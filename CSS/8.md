# Responsive Design

Responsive web design ensures that web pages render well on different devices and window sizes. The goal is to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

## Media Queries

Media queries allow you to apply CSS rules based on the device's characteristics, such as screen width or height.

**Example:**
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
```
