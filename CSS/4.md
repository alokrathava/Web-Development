# CSS Selectors

Selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style. CSS offers a variety of selectors to target elements.

## Basic Selectors

### Element Selector
The element selector selects all elements of a specific type.

**Example:**
```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```

### Class Selector
The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. Classes are defined using a period `.` followed by the class name.

**Example:**
```css
.button {
    background-color: blue;
}
```

### ID Selector
The ID selector selects a single element with a specific ID attribute. IDs are defined using a hash `#` followed by the ID name.

**Example:**
```css
#header {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```
