# CSS Box Model

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that describes the structure of a web page. It includes the content, padding, border, and margin of an element. Understanding the box model is crucial for layout design.

## The Structure of the Box Model

- **Content**: The actual content of the box, where text and images appear.
- **Padding**: Clears an area around the content. Padding is transparent.
- **Border**: A border surrounding the padding (if any) and content.
- **Margin**: Clears an area outside the border. The margin is also transparent.

**Example:**
```css
div {
    width: 300px;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 5px solid gray;
    margin: 20px;
}
```
