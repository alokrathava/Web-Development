# Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and layout web pages. It allows you to separate the content of a page (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). CSS is used to control the color, font, layout, and even animations on a website. Understanding CSS is essential for creating visually appealing web pages.

## Why Use CSS?

CSS is used to create a consistent look and feel across multiple web pages. By using CSS, you can control the layout of multiple pages at once, which makes it easier to maintain and update your website. Additionally, CSS helps to keep the HTML code clean and more readable.
