# CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items are arranged within a flex container, and you can control the alignment, direction, and order of items.

## Flex Container Properties

### `display: flex;`
This property defines a flex container and enables a flex context for all its direct children.

### `flex-direction`
Defines the direction in which the flex items are placed in the flex container.

**Example:**
```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
}
```
