# CSS Syntax

CSS syntax is composed of selectors and declaration blocks. A selector targets the HTML element(s) you want to style, and the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

**Syntax:**
```css
selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
}
```

### Example
```css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this example, `p` is the selector targeting all `<p>` elements, `color` is the property, and `blue` is the value assigned to the color property.
