# Using W3.CSS Framework

W3.CSS is a modern, responsive CSS framework with built-in classes that simplify the process of styling web pages. It is lightweight and does not depend on JavaScript libraries.

## Basic W3.CSS Structure

### Including W3.CSS
To use W3.CSS in your project, include it in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
```

### W3.CSS Containers
W3.CSS containers are used to create responsive, fixed-width layouts. They are the building blocks of W3.CSS.

**Example:**
```html
<div class="w3-container w3-teal">
  <h1>My Header</h1>
</div>
```
